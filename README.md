This was coded on August 2018

----------------------------------------------------
These are some instructions from Julian

Hi Alberto, I'm sharing all the files related to the proect. In the folder for every bat, you will
find the data files, video files, and the MATLAB file corresponding to the directory used to run
code for that bat. You will also have access to the README file (which I suggest you look over as
you try to understand the code), the actual code (including all the supporting files as well as the
main file), and the file that explains the naming convention for the points. Let me know if you have
any questions. Looking forward to your thoughts and feedback! I don't think anyone has actually
tried to run this without me being there, so hopefully the code and the README are understandable.
Best, Julian

---------------------------------------------------

As of Aug 2019 I have not ran the code, ultimately I want to incorporate this functionality to the
biolocomotion toolbok.`

this code contained videos and powerpoint presentation and a bunch of other files that dont belong
in a code repository. i have made a copy of the original directory that julian gave me and placed it
in the drive Bat_Durip/julian-original-bat-animation.
